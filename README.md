# 📝 Simple Blog Web Application


A simple blog web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. Posts are stored in memory, meaning they are not persistent between sessions. This project focuses on basic full-stack web development and styling for a seamless user experience across devices.

# 📌 Project Description
The goal of this capstone project is to create a fully functional blog web app that demonstrates fundamental web development skills using Node.js and Express.js for the backend and EJS for the templating engine. The application does not use a database in this version — all blog posts are held in memory while the server is running. Emphasis is placed on both functionality and responsive design.
