# üìù  BLOGGO

Bloggo is a simple blogging platform built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It's designed to be minimal, distraction-free, and easy to use‚Äîwhether you're journaling, sharing ideas, or just playing around with web development.

# üìå Project Description
The goal of this capstone project is to create a fully functional blog web app that demonstrates fundamental web development skills using Node.js and Express.js for the backend and EJS for the templating engine. The application does use a database in this version ‚Äî all blog posts are saved to a database while the server is running.

This project is inspired by the style and layout of <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham's articles.</a>

#### Notes from the Developer
It‚Äôs my first real full-stack web app, and I‚Äôm actively improving it as I learn more. Feel free to explore, give feedback, or fork it for your own projects.
